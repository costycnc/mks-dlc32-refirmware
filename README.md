# mks-dlc2-refirmware
Firmare for costycnc foam cutter machine

In general , my clients are unexpert and principiants so when some client decided to change the arduino nano cnc shield v4 with mks dlc32 wifi shield , at official https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-DLC32 address have many option and user not understand what version of firmware upload to wifi shield.
Anyway ,any firmware have is own caracteristic , for example if user ude a display , need to upload to wifi module the respective firmware for display that have.
But i suppose that client not have display (have only board without display) and want only to refirmware the cnc module, in this case i put here a basic firmware that mks raccomand!
